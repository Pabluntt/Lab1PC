The NHL game turned when the team capitalized on a power play in the third period. The goalie made a huge save on a breakaway, 
deflecting the puck with his blocker. After a clean faceoff win, the defensemen set up a slap shot from the blue line. Their penalty kill 
remained solid despite back-to-back minors. Fans cheered as the captain lifted the Stanley Cup.
