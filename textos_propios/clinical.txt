The clinical trial was randomized and placebo-controlled to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Participants reported mild symptoms like fatigue and 
headache, with no severe adverse events. Researchers monitored biomarkers and ran blood tests at scheduled visits. The diagnosis criteria 
followed established guidelines to ensure reproducibility. Results will undergo peer review before publication.
