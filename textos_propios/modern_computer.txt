Modern computer graphics relies on the GPU to accelerate the rendering pipeline. Techniques like rasterization, anti-aliasing, 
and shader programs are common in OpenGL and DirectX. Ray tracing produces realistic reflections and global illumination but can be 
computationally expensive. Texture mapping and mipmaps help with performance and image quality. Many engines also use post-processing effects 
like bloom and tone mapping.
